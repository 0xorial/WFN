## Project Description
WFN started as an "extension" to the embedded Windows firewall, and offers real time connections monitoring, connections map, bandwidth usage monitoring...

I finally decided to give the code to the community (as many people asked me too, and since I do not have that much free time to keep working on it).
Enjoy ;-)

Please read the documentation about the features and limitation of WFN. Especially note that WFN is **not** a firewall itself!

## Last update
**2017.05.20 - v2.0 beta 1**
Head to the [release:corresponding page](631360) if you are interested in trying the latest beta version, and **keep in mind, this is work in progress! Read the full description page before downloading!**

## Requirements
WFN requires Windows Vista SP2 or later (Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10...) with Microsoft .NET 4.5.2 or higher. Windows Server 2008 or later are not officially supported, but WFN should work fine on them.
_Please do not ask for a Windows XP version, since WFN relies on features introduced with Vista, it would require too much work. Well, now that it is open source, maybe someone will port it but keep in mind there are great alternatives out there. And, well, Windows XP is dead now, time to move on!_

## Donations (or _"How can I show how much I like this project?"_)
While I hate having to write this, I am seeking for some funds to help me work on personal projects. I promised I'll keep WFN free for everyone, and I will, but if each of those who downloaded this soft gave as little as 1$, it would have been really helpful, as you can guess. Of course I am not forcing anyone and I know many people who need the exact same dollar to survive, but I have to give it a try.
**If you feel generous, you can head to [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=wokhan%40online%2efr&lc=US&item_name=Khan%20%28Windows%20Firewall%20Notifier%29&item_number=WOK%2dWFN&currency_code=EUR&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted).**
Additional note: if you can't donate or don't want to, **you can also click on the ad in the right column of those pages**, as I get a (very) little something each time you do.
 **Thank you, and sorry for this message!**

## Thanks
Thank you fellow users, it's great to see my little soft being downloaded that much (of course I hope you keep it and use it afterwards ;-) ).
**Thanks to everyone who contributed and donated, and of course to people who will! I'm really glad to see many users support the project and as I said many times, this is the greatest motivation!**
